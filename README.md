Animated light/dark mode toggle for your Power Apps so you don't have to use a boring dropdown ðŸ˜œ 

A simple component built using HTML & SVG with added 3 types of animation to add a little sparkle ðŸ¦„

The component has a couple of very simple properties:

â—» LinearGradientColour1 and 2 â€“ the gradient colours (HEX or RGB). If you want a unified colour, please put the same value in both fields

â—¼ Label â€“ this is a toggle to show/hide the label

â—» LabelTrueText and LabelFalseText - the text for the label (e.g. Dark/Light)

â—¼ FontSize â€“ font size of the label

â—» Animation â€“ just type in 1, 2 or 3. 1 is a breathe in animation, 2 is a bounce in, and 3 is a rotate animation.

â—¼ LabelColour â€“ color of the label. You can put in a variable here too.

To make sure the background changes colour, you'll need to use the output property of the component (AnimatedToggle.Toggled). Example - If(AnimatedToggle.Toggled = true, RGBA(0,0,0,1), RGBA(255,255,255,1))

And please don't forget - this is a sample code for you to reuse, not a library!

Happy Power Apping ðŸ˜Š
